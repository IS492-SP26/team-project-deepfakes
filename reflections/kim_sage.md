#### Summary:

As AI has become widely used in various fields and methods nowadays, lots of side effects have occurred as much as its advantages. However, the existing taxonomies about AI risks are too centered around professional and governmental perspectives and are difficult for the public to understand. Therefore, Abercrombie et al. (2024) suggested a new AI harm taxonomy which is clearer, more understandable, and flexible by analyzing an actual AI harm database, collecting feedback from experts, and conducting annotation testing multiple times. As a result, they finalized AI harms into nine major categories (Autonomy, Physical, Psychological, Reputational, Financial & Business, Human Rights & Civil Liberties, Societal & Cultural, Political & Economic, and Environmental), with 69 sub-categories under these main categories. With the new taxonomy, they aim to provide valuable reference for AI Governance, risk management, policy making, and so on. 

#### Insights:
- One incident can cause multiple harms across different categories. For example, a deepfake incident may produce various harms that fall into multiple taxonomy categories, such as psychological, reputational, and autonomy harms.
- It is important to distinguish potential harm and actual harm, because they could be used in a different way. For example, potential harm data can be used for threat modeling, and actual harm data can be used as an evidence or for pattern analysis.
- Clear and structured harm taxonomy can empower civil society organizations, journalists, and citizens by enabling clearer identification and reporting of AI-related harms. This implies the importance of building a structured taxonomy to reduce AI harm. 

#### Limitations/risks:
- The taxonomy in this paper is still in an early stage of development and not yet tested outside of the working group, it might be not very reliable or useful for real-world cases.
- Classification could cause oversimplification and normalization issues, minimizing the severity of the risk or importance of the event

#### Idea:

I believe our group could use this taxonomy when identifying the types of harm in deepfake incidents and implement a multi-label harm tagging system, since what we plan to build is a deepfake incident database, and Abercrombie et al. (2024) suggest that one incident can cause multiple harms.
