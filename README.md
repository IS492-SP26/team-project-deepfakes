This project will attempt to create a “Threat Intelligence Platform,” tracking & logging cases where generative AI is used to create non-consensual explicit images. We plan to create an incident repository, showing specific incidents of deepfaking. We would allow timely updates with new major incidents, as we’d try to make it a dynamic / self-updating repository.

Specifics: platform failures (Grok bypassed to create explicit content), targeted extortion, legal precedents
Tech Stack: scrapers (Python; BeautifulSoup), LLM (Llama 3) to extract metadata, create taxonomy in SQL database
